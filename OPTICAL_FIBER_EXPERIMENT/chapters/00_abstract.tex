Optical fibers are integral components of modern communication systems, facilitating the transmission of data over long distances with minimal signal loss. In this experimental study, we investigate key optical fiber characteristics, namely bending losses, splice losses, and numerical aperture, to enhance our understanding of their performance in real-world applications.\\

Bending losses refer to the attenuation of light signals as they traverse curved paths within optical fibers. Our experiment involves subjecting optical fibers to various bending radii and angles to quantify the impact of bending on signal integrity. The results provide valuable insights into the minimum bend radius required to maintain acceptable signal quality, which is crucial for the design of fiber optic networks.\\

Splice losses arise when optical fibers are joined together, and understanding these losses is essential for efficient network deployment and maintenance. We analyze the impact of different splice techniques on signal continuity and attenuation, aiming to identify the most effective methods for minimizing splice losses.\\

Numerical aperture (NA) is a fundamental optical parameter that characterizes the light-gathering ability of an optical fiber. We measure and calculate the numerical aperture of various optical fibers to assess their performance in terms of light-capturing efficiency. Understanding the NA is vital for optimizing fiber optic systems for specific applications, such as telecommunications and medical devices.\\

Our experimental setup employs state-of-the-art equipment and precise measurement techniques to ensure accurate results. The findings from this study will aid in the development of more robust and efficient optical fiber communication systems, paving the way for advancements in high-speed data transmission, telemedicine, and various other optical fiber-based technologies.\\
