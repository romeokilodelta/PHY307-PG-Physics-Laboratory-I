\chapter{Precautions}%
\begin{enumerate}

\item Eye Protection: Always wear appropriate eye protection when working with optical fibers to prevent potential eye damage from laser or high-intensity light sources.

\item Fiber Handling: Treat optical fibers with extreme care to avoid microbending or damage. Minimize bending and twisting of fibers during setup and measurements.

\item Laser Safety: If lasers are used, adhere to laser safety protocols, including laser hazard assessments and the use of laser safety goggles where necessary.

\item Alignment: Ensure precise alignment of optical components, such as lenses, fiber connectors, and splice devices, to minimize signal losses due to misalignment.

\item Clean Environment: Work in a clean and dust-free environment to prevent contaminants from adhering to the fiber's surface, which can cause signal losses.
