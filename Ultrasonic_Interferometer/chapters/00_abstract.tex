This experimental study focuses on employing an ultrasonic interferometer to measure the ultrasonic velocity in a liquid medium and, consequently, determine the compressibility of the liquid. Ultrasonic interferometry is a precise and non-destructive technique widely used for characterizing the acoustic properties of materials. In this experiment, a high-frequency ultrasonic wave is passed through the liquid sample in the sample, and the resulting standing waves between the parallel metallic reflector and the quartz crystal are analyzed.\\

The experimental setup includes a precision ultrasonic interferometer, a sample chamber and RF Generator(2 MHz) cum micro-Ammeter. The ultrasonic interferometer consist of transducer crystal at the bottom of the cell, which is driven by a crystal controlled oscillator fixed frequency.
Ultrasonic wave is transmitted to the liquid in contact with the transducer and reflected back from the metal plate, placed at a distance from the transducer in the liquid. The reflective wave is received by the same transducer and a meter indicates the position of the metal reflector is at node or anti node. Stationary wave is formed in the liquid.\\

The results obtained through this experiment provide valuable insights into the acoustic behavior of the liquid under investigation. Moreover, the method's accuracy and reliability are assessed, demonstrating the feasibility of ultrasonic interferometry for determining both ultrasonic velocity and compressibility of liquids.\\
