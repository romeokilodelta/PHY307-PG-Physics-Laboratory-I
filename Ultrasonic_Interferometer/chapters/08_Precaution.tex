\begin{enumerate}

\item Do not switch on the generator without filling the experimental liquid in
the cell.
 \item Remove experimental liquid out of cell after use. Keep it cleaned and
dried.
 \item Avoid sudden rise or fall in temperature of circulated liquid to prevent
thermal shock to the quartz crystal.
 \item While cleaning the cell care should be taken not to spoil or scratch the
gold plating on the quartz crystal.
 \item Give your generator 15 seconds warming up time before the observation.
